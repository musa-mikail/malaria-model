Malaria Diagnosis with AI ‚Äì Capstone Project
Author: Musa Mikail
Program: Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
Date: July 2019

üìå Project Overview
This project aims to develop i-mal, a Windows PC application that uses machine learning to assist in the diagnosis of malaria from microscopic blood smear images. The goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy and accessibility, especially in rural areas of northern Nigeria.

üåç Domain Background
Malaria remains a major health challenge in Nigeria, with millions of cases and thousands of deaths annually. Traditional diagnosis relies on manual inspection of blood cells, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. AI offers a scalable solution to enhance diagnostic precision.

üéØ Problem Statement
Develop a user-friendly application that:

Detects malaria-infected cells using a CNN-based binary classifier.
Counts total red blood cells using edge detection.
Calculates parasitemia (%P) to aid diagnosis.
üß™ Dataset
Source: U.S. National Library of Medicine
27,558 labeled PNG images (balanced: 13,780 parasitized, 13,780 uninfected)
75% for training, 25% for validation/testing
üõ†Ô∏è Solution Approach
Preprocessing: Image scaling, rotation, augmentation
Model: CNN (VGGNet architecture), benchmarked against a vanilla ANN
Training: Amazon SageMaker
Deployment: PyQt-based GUI with OpenCV for edge detection
Output: % of infected cells (parasitemia)
